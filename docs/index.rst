Welcome to BESIM's documentation!
==========================================================

`BESIM` is an open-source Python-package for simulation in building energy systems, and has been under continuous development as part of the project PiegStrom. `BESIM` contains a time step simulation engine and an extendable framework for integration. Please, check the :ref:`installation` procedures to install `BESIM` in your local machine.

   Forschungszentrum Jülich IEK-3 Team

We are the `Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3) <https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/DE/Home/home_node.html>`_ belonging to the `Forschungszentrum Jülich <https://www.fz-juelich.de>`_. Our interdisciplinary institute's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
